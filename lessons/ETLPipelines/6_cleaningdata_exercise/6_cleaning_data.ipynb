    "# Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning data is a big topic. Every data set might have its own issues whether that involves missing values, duplicated entries, data entry mistakes, etc. In this exercise, you'll do some data cleaning on the World Bank projects and World Bank indicators data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the projects data and the indicators data have different values for country names. Your task in this exercise is to clean both data sets so that they have consistent country names. This will allow you to join the two data sets together. Cleaning data, unfortunately, can be tedious and take a lot of your time as a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might you want to join these data sets together? What if, for example, you wanted to run linear regression to try to predict project costs based on indicator data? Or you might want to analyze the types of projects that get approved versus the indicator data. For example, do countries with low rates of rural electrification have more rural themed projects?"
